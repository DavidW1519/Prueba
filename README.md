## Configuration

2. We can use default values for most fields except the Jira section. For how to set up basic authorization with Jira, please see this [section](#jira) below

## Usage

### Create a Collection Job

1. From the terminal, execute `npm run all`
2. From Postman (or similar), send a request like...

```json

POST http://localhost:3001/

{
    "jira": {
        "projectId": "10003",
        "accountUri": "merico.atlassian.net"
    }
}

```

3. See that the collection job was published, jira collection ran, the enrichment job was published, and jira enrichment ran

To run only the enrichment job on existing collections: `POST http://localhost:3000/`
