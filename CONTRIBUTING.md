# Contributing to Lake

👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Lake. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.*


## How Can I Contribute?

1. Reporting bugs by filling out the required issue template and labeling the new issue as 'bug'.

2. Suggesting enhancements.

If you intend to change the public API, or make any non-trivial changes to the implementation, we recommend filing an issue. This lets us reach an agreement on your proposal before you put significant effort into it.

If you’re only fixing a bug, it’s fine to submit a pull request right away but we still recommend to file an issue detailing what you’re fixing. This is helpful in case we don’t accept that specific fix but want to keep track of the issue.
