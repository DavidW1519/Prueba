Recover\r\nRecovering indiscriminately from panics is a dubious practice because the state of a package’s variables after a panic is rarely well defined or documented. Perhaps a critical update to a data structure was incomplete, a file or net work connection was opened but not closed, or a lock was acquired but not released. Furthermore, by replacing a crash with, say, a line in a log file, indiscriminate recovery may cause bugs to go unnoticed.\r\n\r\n---\r\nname: Pull request\r\nabout: Propose changes to the code\r\ntitle: ''\r\nlabels: ''\r\nassignees: ''\r\n---\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing to `ants`!

the bug**\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n\r\n目前的项目描述里提到，“ ants 是一个高性能且低损耗的 goroutine 协程池。”，这个说法是不正确的，goroutine 不是协程。\r\n\r\n首先，goroutine 不是我们通常说的协作式调度，绝大部分的 go 程序都是没有 runtime.Gosched 的。如果认为 go scheduler 内部的抢占调度目前不完善，那 linux 内核在 2.几 某个版本之前也没有完善的抢占调度，难道 linux 线程也是协程吗。\r\n\r\n另外，预期 Go 1.14 就有完全的抢占调度了，更跟协程不搭边了。\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.

Please describe how these code changes achieve your intention.\r\nI found that loop_queue had an intention to use binarysearch method, just like worker_stack. But it's removed before being merged into the master branch due to some bugs.  I mapped true positions to imaginary positions before using binarysearch method and also add some tests to make sure it works.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 3.

Please describe how these code changes achieve your intention.\r\n<!-- Please be specific. Motivate the problem, and justify why this is the best solution. -->\r\n\r\nWhile reading through the library it became clear to me that `PoolWithFunc` was just a specific case of `Pool`, where instead of submitting tasks, the caller simply passes arguments for a pre-defined function to be run on the workers. This means that, instead of a `chan func() interface{}` as the message queue, we use a `chan interface{}`, and IMO this shouldn't warrant a completely different `Pool` implementation.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes the complete removal of the `worker_func.go` file, choosing instead to adapt `PoolWithFunc` to use the default `Pool`, changing `.Invoke` to simply call the underlying `Pool.Submit` method with an anonymous function wrapping `p.poolFunc(args)`, transforming it into a `goWorker` accepted task, giving us a more robust and simpler library.\r\n\r\n## 3.

(w *goWorker) run() {\r\n\tw.pool.incRunning()\r\n\tgo func() {\r\n\t\tdefer func() {\r\n\t\t\tw.pool.decRunning()\r\n\t\t\tw.pool.workerCache.Put(w) // 这里放到了cache中\r\n\t\t\tif p := recover(); p != nil {\r\n\t\t\t\tif ph := w.pool.options.PanicHandler; ph != nil {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tph(p)\r\n\t\t\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tw.pool.options.Logger.Printf(\""worker exits from a panic: %v\\n\"", p)\r\n\t\t\t\t\tvar buf [4096]byte\r\n\t\t\t\t\tn := runtime.Stack(buf[:], false)\r\n\t\t\t\t\tw.pool.options.Logger.Printf(\""worker exits from panic: %s\\n\"", string(buf[:n]))\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}()\r\n\r\n\t\tfor f := range w.task {\r\n\t\t\tif f == nil {\r\n\t\t\t\treturn\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\tf()\r\n\t\t\tif ok := w.pool.revertWorker(w); !ok {  // 这里把空闲worker放回了workArray中\r\n\t\t\t\treturn\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n由于goWorker是引用，所以同一个goWorker会同时存在于workerArray和sync.Pool中，会不会出现一种情况，从sync.Pool中Get的worker其实在还在有效期中，最终导致goroutine pool中运行的worker数量是”假“的，因为有两个worker是同一个\r\n\r\n这种情况可能需要测试，并行测试较难复现我说的场景，如果您对于这块有比较好的解答，感谢~\r\n\r\n"",""reactions"":{""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/panjf2000/ants/issues/102/reactions"",""total_count"":0,""+1"":0,""-1"":0,""laugh"":0,""hooray"":0,""confused"":0,""heart"":0,""rocket"":0,""eyes"":0},""timeline_url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/panjf2000/ants/issues/102/timeline"",""performed_via_github_app"":null,""state_reason"":""completed""}",https://api.github.com/repos/panjf2000/ants/issues?direction=asc&page=2&per_page=100&state=all,null,2022-06-13

 因为有可能是收到广播信号，此时不能保证 p.Running() <= capacity 。\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t\tw = p.workers.detach()\r\n\t\tif w == nil {\r\n\t\t\tgoto Reentry\r\n\t\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\n但是，我觉得可以通过修改成下面的代码解决掉这个问题\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t\tw = p.workers.detach()\r\n\t\tif w == nil {\r\n\t\t\tif p.Running() < capacity {\r\n\t\t\t\tspawnWorker()\r\n\t\t\t\tp.lock.Unlock()\r\n\t\t\t\treturn\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\tgoto Reentry\r\n\t\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\n由于作者没有采用类似这样的写法，导致需要增加 `if p.Running() == 0` 这段代码处理广播信号。\r\n\r\n再来看广播信号，广播信号是在定时回收时，满足下面的条件触发的。\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t\t// There might be a situation that all workers have been cleaned up(no any worker is running)\r\n\t\t// while some invokers still get stuck in \""p.cond.Wait()\"",\r\n\t\t// then it ought to wakes all those invokers.\r\n\t\tif p.Running() == 0 {\r\n\t\t\tp.cond.Broadcast()\r\n\t\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\n为什么需要这段代码？原因在于需要考虑这么一种情况，当 retrieveWorker() 发现 runing() 个数超过了容量，因此在 p.cond.Wait() 中。之后 runing() 的所有 worker f() 都发生了 panic，按当前的代码逻辑，是无法正常归还到工作池中的，revertWorker 不会被调用，也就是 revertWorker 不会发出 Signal 通知。因此，如果我们检测到没有1个worker running，就 Broadcast 信号。\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor f := range w.task {\r\n\t\r\n\tif f == nil {\r\n\t\treturn\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\t// 需要考虑 f() panic 的情况，此时不会归还到工作池中\r\n\tf()\r\n\t\r\n\tif ok := w.pool.revertWorker(w); !ok {\r\n\t\treturn\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n因此广播信号的加入，确实增加了复杂度。能不能在work run() 中包装调用 f() ，处理 panic ?"",""reactions"":{""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/panjf2000/ants/issues/143/reactions"",""total_count"":0,""+1"":0,""-1"":0,""laugh"":0,""hooray"":0,""confused"":0,""heart"":0,""rocket"":0,""eyes"":0},""timeline_url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/panjf2000/ants/issues/143/timeline"",""performed_via_github_app"":null,""state_reason"":null}",https://api.github.com/repos/panjf2000/ants/issues?direction=asc&page=2&per_page=100&state=all,null,2022-06-13 15:35:56.526312 +00:00

The bench function it called is not the same as [1M tasks](https://github.com/panjf2000/ants#1m-tasks) and [100k tasks](https://github.com/panjf2000/ants#100k-tasks). It is partly the same as the pic [benchmarks-with-poolwithfunc](https://github.com/panjf2000/ants#benchmarks-with-poolwithfunc) above.\r\n And I didn't see the bench function it called ,naming \""BenchmarkGoroutineWithFunc\"",\""BenchmarkAntsPoolWithFunc\"", exists in the source code. Maybe it has already been removed from the src, or changed to \""^TestAntsPoolWithFunc...\""\r\n\r\n2. About throughput and latency\r\n In [here](https://github.com/panjf2000/ants#throughput-it-is-suitable-for-scenarios-where-tasks-are-submitted-asynchronously-without-waiting-for-the-final-results), you describe the result as a kind of throughput,but maybe it should be more like a one-way latency (you just commit the job,and never wait it to be done)\r\n Throughput should be calculated like  [here](https://github.com/panjf2000/ants/blob/master/ants_benchmark_test.go#L64) , using wg.Wait() to get the total elapsed time t, and divide it to the number of goroutines committed, e.g.\"" t / #goroutine \""\r\n That's a clear question when facing pipeline.\r\n The Image [performance-summary](https://github.com/panjf2000/ants#-performance-summary) uses \""Goroutine throughput benchmark\"" as its title, but using memory and latency as its y-label, which is confusing. Maybe \""throughput\"" should be removed\r\n\r\n3. About the performance,I tried to run the bench for more than 3 times, and got the following results.\r\nThe results seem to be very different from the bench in your [README](https://github.com/panjf2000/ants#benchmarks-with-pool)\r\n\r\nAbout my machine&env:\r\n```\r\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i5-8250U CPU @ 1.60GHz\r\n\r\ngo version go1.16.2 windows/amd64\r\n```\r\n\r\n3.1 Using Test\r\nThe only quoted variable `n` has been set to ` n        = 10000000 `, e.g. 10M\r\nIt seems that TestAntsPool runs slower than TestNoPool, though the memory saved is obviously huge.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nPS D:\\go-work\\src\\github.com\\panjf2000\\ants> go test -run=NoPool -v\r\n=== RUN   TestNoPool\r\n    ants_test.go:210: memory usage:789 MB\r\n--- PASS: TestNoPool (5.04s)\r\nPASS\r\nok      github.com/panjf2000/ants/v2    5.154s\r\n\r\nPS D:\\go-work\\src\\github.com\\panjf2000\\ants> go test -run=\""AntsPool$\"" -v\r\n=== RUN   TestAntsPool\r\n    ants_test.go:225: pool, capacity:2147483647\r\n    ants_test.go:226: pool, running workers number:19360\r\n    ants_test.go:227: pool, free workers number:2147464287\r\n    ants_test.go:232: memory usage:184 MB\r\n--- PASS: TestAntsPool (7.41s)\r\nPASS\r\nok      github.com/panjf2000/ants/v2    7.528s\r\n```\r\n\r\n3.2 Using Benchmark\r\nI first set the param to 1M tasks and 50k pool capacity,just like what you set in [README](https://github.com/panjf2000/ants#-benchmarks)\r\nHere the performance is significantly higher than \""without pool\""\r\n```sh\r\nRunning tool: D:\\GO\\bin\\go.exe test -benchmem -run=^$ -bench ^(BenchmarkGoroutines)$ github.com/panjf2000/ants/v2\r\n\r\ngoos: windows\r\ngoarch: amd64\r\npkg: github.com/panjf2000/ants/v2\r\ncpu: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8250U CPU @ 1.60GHz\r\nBenchmarkGoroutines-8   \t       1\t10773745800 ns/op\t509732352 B/op\t 1996637 allocs/op\r\nPASS\r\nok  \tgithub.com/panjf2000/ants/v2\t11.616s\r\n\r\nRunning tool: D:\\GO\\bin\\go.exe test -benchmem -run=^$ -bench ^(BenchmarkAntsPool)$ github.com/panjf2000/ants/v2\r\n\r\ngoos: windows\r\ngoarch: amd64\r\npkg: github.com/panjf2000/ants/v2\r\ncpu: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8250U CPU @ 1.60GHz\r\nBenchmarkAntsPool-8   \t       2\t 712292750 ns/op\t21032456 B/op\t 1063341 allocs/op\r\nPASS\r\nok  \tgithub.com/panjf2000/ants/v2\t2.363s\r\n```\r\nIt is weird for me to see the different result, given the src code is nearly the same.\r\n\r\n4. Is it OK to use a [only sleep function](https://github.com/panjf2000/ants/blob/master/ants_benchmark_test.go#L39) acting as worker?\r\nMaybe changing the demoFunc to a CPU-bound func like the following, or a related compromise.\r\n```go\r\n// func demoFunc() {\r\n// \ttime.Sleep(time.Duration(BenchParam) * time.Millisecond)\r\n// }\r\nfunc demoFunc() {\r\n\tbegin := time.Now()\r\n\ti := 0\r\n\tfor {\r\n\t\ti++\r\n\t\tend := time.Now()\r\n\t\tif end.UnixNano()-begin.UnixNano() > int64(time.Millisecond)*BenchParam {\r\n\t\t\treturn\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. However, in this [issue](https://github.com/panjf2000/ants/issues/123), you admit that the performance isn't higher than the plain goroutine anymore. Please UPDATE THE README!\r\n\r\nIf I have any error,correct me plz. That's my pleasure to see such an awesome project in saving memory alloction, avoiding unlimited goroutine constructions.\r\n\r\n\r\n"",""reactions"":{""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/panjf2000/ants/issues/144/reactions"",""total_count"":0,""+1"":0,""-1"":0,""laugh"":0,""hooray"":0,""confused"":0,""heart"":0,""rocket"":0,""eyes"":0},""timeline_url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/panjf2000/ants/issues/144/timeline"",""performed_via_github_app"":null,""state_reason"":""completed""}",https://api.github.com/repos/panjf2000/ants/issues?direction=asc&page=2&per_page=100&state=all,null,2022-06-13 15:35:56.526312 +00:00

Dear users of `ants`\r\n\r\nThis is a notice about an issue of `ants` in GO modules, the v1.2.0 has been re-tagged with a new commit, which causes the **checksum mismatch** with Go modules and you may encounter this problem sometime, see #49 for details.\r\n\r\nTo cut a long story short, the quick fix for this issue is to replace the version of v1.2.0 with v1.2.1 in your `go.mod`, then you'll be
