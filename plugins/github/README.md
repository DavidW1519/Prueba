# Github Pond

## Metrics

Currently the data is only fetched and stored in the DB. Soon we will have charts in Grafana to support this data.

## Github rate limits

"For API requests using Basic Authentication or OAuth, you can make up to 5,000 requests per hour."

- https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api

If you have a need for more api rate limits, you can set many tokens in the config file and we will use all of your tokens.

NOTE: You can get 15000 requests/hour/token if you pay for github enterprise.

## Configuration

In your .env file, you will need to set up

```

GITHUB_AUTH=XXX

or...

GITHUB_AUTH=XXX,YYY,ZZZ // where each token is a different user's token (optional)
```

## Sample Request

```
curl --location --request POST 'localhost:8080/task' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '[[{
    "Plugin": "github",
    "Options": {
        "repositoryName": "lake",
        "owner": "merico-dev"
    }
}]]'
```
